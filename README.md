This code creates an interactive form that allows users to select their favorite Marvel Original Six 
character. When a user clicks the "Select" button for a character, the form is submitted, and the 
server-side script can then process the selected character's name (e.g., "Iron Man") to perform 
actions like: 
• Displaying more information about the selected character. 
• Storing the user's preference in a database. 
• Triggering other actions based on the user's choice.
